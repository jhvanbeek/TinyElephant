# TinyElephant
Drawing the shape of an elephant with four parameters

## These tiny programs in R draw the (crude) shape of an elephant.
## They implement the equations in 
## Mayer, J., Khairy, K., Howard, J.
## Drawing an elephant with four complex parameters
## Am.J.Phys. 78: 648-649, 2010
## 
## To execute one of the programs, install the open source R environment: www.r-project.org
## One of the ways to run it in the R Graphical User Interface is to set the working directory
## to the directory containing this file and type at the prompt:
## source("TinyElephant.R")
## 

## The parameters in the equations can of be modified to experiment with drawing
## various shapes. 
## ShapeExperiment.R is better suited to experiment with drawing other shapes.
